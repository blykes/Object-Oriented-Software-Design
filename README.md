# Object-Oriented-Software-Design

This was our frist class in Java with a dabbling in Python. 
The goal of the class was not just to learn Java but more of the things that 
go into software desgn, such as the concept of an MVP and general design philosphies. 
Basically the things you want to think about before you even start coding.
